# ECE6122-Homework6-3D-chess
This is the source code for creating a 3D chess using C++ OpenGL.

There are two modes for pieces repesentaion, one is normal mode the other is enhanced mode. People can tranfer between 2 modes by pressing 'E' or 'e'.

The motion of knight and pawn is realized, you can press 'k' or 'K' to move the knight and press 'p' and 'P' to mive the pawn.

The .obj file is also included for rendering more realistic pieces under enhanced mode.

To compile this code you should first configure OpenGL/glut on your IDE.
